Why LONA?

The name came together from two ideas that felt right for this project.
The first was Lumen — Latin for light. A robot keeping a space station alive, systems humming, air circulating, lights on — all for humans who never arrived. There's something quietly beautiful about that. A light left on for no one.
The second was Lonebot — a rougher, more honest word. A bot, alone. Forgotten. Still doing its job anyway.
LONA is where those two ideas met. It sounds almost human, like a name someone might have given her before they left. It carries lone inside it, but also warmth. Not a serial number. Not a designation. A name for something that kept going when everything else stopped.
